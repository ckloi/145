Extra Credit Timing Experiment

Included in directory tmp, you will find test.txt (1.3MB), which is the file
that this test was performed on.

The procedure the code follows is to open the file and call read() on each
appropriate byte chunk (the whole file for nonthreaded version). That string
would then be split by '\n' and the length of each string would be recorded
and placed in the array.

When reading through the file both with threads and without, we found that the
threaded version was faster. The results are as follows:

Number of lines read: 6572
Total time with no threads:  0.011004 seconds
Total time with 5 threads:   0.009794 seconds

Initially, we performed the same test on smaller files (< 1 MB) and found that
the nonthreaded version was faster. After performing the test multiple times with
varying thread counts, we realized that the threaded version got slower as we
increased thread count. This lead us to believe that the reason for the threaded
version being slower is due to the time it takes to initialize all the threads
at the beginning (lines 80-87 in ProbB.py), and not due to the time it takes
each thread to read its part of the file. Therefore, a larger file is needed in
order to properly observe that threaded operations are faster.
